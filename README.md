# Peculiar Token

This Solidity program is a program that creates a token on the blockchain network called Peculiar. It is named after the author and has a token abbreviation of PEC.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two functions:

1.  mintToken, which has two parameters - an address (the address the token will be sent to when the token is minted), and a uint value (the amount of token to be minted). 

2. burnToken to destroy the tokens. this also takes in the same parameters as the mintToken, but does the exact opposite.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* To execute this smart contract and interact with it, I recommend you use Remix. You can access it here: https://remix.ethereum.org/.

* Create a new file on Remix and copy and paste this code. Ensure that the compiler version in Remix's inbuilt compiler is the same declared in the contract.

* To find the compiler, search and click on "Compiler". After compilation, deploy it with the deploy button and if successful, you can then be able to interact with the smart contract.
